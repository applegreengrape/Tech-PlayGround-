# [üïπÔ∏è Tech PlayGround](https://tech-playground.netlify.app)

[üïπÔ∏è Tech PlayGround](https://tech-playground.netlify.app) is a community blog for people to share tech projects, tips, best practices, verdicts or just fun facts of live ü¶©. The theme is designed by JM Fergeau, who got the idea from HUGO.386 [BOOTSTRA.386](//github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) theme. It has a cool MS-DOS feeling and is ready to be used for blogs. Despite its antique look, the theme is responsive and can be viewed on mobile devices.
